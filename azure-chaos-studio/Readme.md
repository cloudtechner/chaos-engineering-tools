# Azure Chaos studio

Azure Chaos Studio is provided as a service, which means you donâ€™t have to deploy your own infrastructure first to get it up and running. Azure Chaos Studio Preview is a fully managed chaos engineering experimentation platform for accelerating the discovery of hard-to-find problems, from late-stage development through production.

* About: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/
* Tutorial: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-quickstart-azure-portal
* Azure Chaos studio is SAAS service ((fully managed service by Azure)
* We can use Azure Chaos Studio via azure portal and azure cli and azure chaos packages.
